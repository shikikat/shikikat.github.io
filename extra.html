This story is based on a real life event. Throughout the story the bunny faces cases of parental abuse and abandonment at a young age. They are dehumanized (deanimalized in this case) by their family and treated as a demon. Although the mother figure was there to protect the bunny there are signs of abuse on the mother's end as well. Depending on the viewer's choices they come to the conclusion that the mother has passed away. 
  </p>
  <p>
After losing their family, the bunny searches for another place to call home. They come across a friend who offers them comfort and security. Depending on the viewer's choice, the bunny has to offer something to their friend in exchange for food. If the viewer chooses to decline the food, the bunny is able to recover the heart they were forced to give up and come to the realization that despite being called a demon their whole life, they look just like everyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
If the other path is taken, the bunny gives up a piece of itself and falls victim to addiction. This addiction can be anything the viewer perceives it to be, but in the long run the bunny is not able to escape.
