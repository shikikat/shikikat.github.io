     <h1>3d Landscape</h1>
	 <hr/>

	 <p>A form of new digital media-- 3d printing allows users to create structures and have it printed 3 dimensionally without the constraints of scale and working around hard to reach places. In this 3d landscape project, the original design is based off of Hayato Miyazaki’s film “Howl’s Moving Castle”. The castle in the film exhibits characteristics from bits and pieces of machinery put together. Throughout the film, the castle roams around on fields of grass. With that in mind the landscape was created to fit that image. Hills, slopes, mountains, a person and sheep were added in the process.</p>
