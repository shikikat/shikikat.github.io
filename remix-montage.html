     <h1>Digital Imaging Montage</h1>
     <p>As technology progresses, it becomes more easily accessible to the public, and in the future this may generate a problem where children abuse the power of technology. They may come to learn about things they shouldn't, and as a solution, adolescences would have to be monitored and the amount of technology accessible to them may be limited. The collage put together is to represent this idea of how digital media affects the public, particularly children.</p>
