	 <hr/>
	
     <p>As technology progresses, it becomes more easily accessible to the public, and in the future this may generate a problem where children abuse the power of technology. They may come to learn about things they shouldn't, and as a solution, adolescences would have to be monitored and the amount of technology accessible to them may be limited. The stuffed animals metaphorically represent children. They are constantly monitored as they are watching an education video on the screen and as a result their heart and minds are manipulated.</p>
